	## Description

	Contains many short executables that are used for testing and debugging the system.

	## Example Files

	This package does not have many classes. Most of the files are .cpp files which contain a main() function and are compiled into executables that run inside ROS nodes. None of the files are really "important" to the system. They are just used for debugging and testing. 

	frontier_test.cpp

	grid_test.cpp

	config_test.cpp
